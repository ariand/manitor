# manitor

manitor displays system information on the GNOME desktop:

- CPU, memory, and swap usage,
- upload and download speeds for one specific network interface,
- the system uptime,
- the time,
- and the free space on some storage devices.

It might work with other compositing window managers, but I have not
tried. It is intended for my own use, so it only does what I need.
If you want to use it â€“ you are on your own.
